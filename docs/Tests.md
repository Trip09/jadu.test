# Running test 
to see the tests running you need to execute the follow command on the repostitory root
./project/vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml.dist

## Controllers

I didn't write test for controllers since I believe a Behaviour Test approach it's more reliable.
As behaviour test tools we can use cucumber.io || behat.org or an online testing tool.
